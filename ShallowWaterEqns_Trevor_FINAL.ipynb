    "The shallow-water equations are a set of partial differential equations derived from the Navier-Stokes equations, which are themselves derived from the equations for the conservation of mass and momentum. I am interested in a very specific application of the shallow-water equations. That is, I would like to apply this approximation to model shallow-water waves. The term shallow water wave refers to a wave in which the characteristic horizontal length scale is much greater than the characteristic vertical length scale. To put this another way, the wavelength is much greater than the amplitude. This set of equations is applicbable to a range of natural phenomena in which vertical dynamics are considered to be very small in comparison to horizontal dynamics, and thus the vertical effects may be neglected. \n",

    "This system has been used for numerous real world applications in the past and are stil frequently used today. As one may imagine, some of the most common uses for this system are within the realm of hydrodynamics, specifically the motion of water in the oceans. One of the most obvious of these is the propogation of the Kelvin and Rossby waves across the Pacific ocean during an El-Ni√±o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) event. This application has been performed numerous times, and is still regularly done in novel ways as we are still not very adept at predicting this phenomenon. Guilyardi et al. provide an excellent overview of ENSO and its current understanding within the realm of modeling at the start of this decade. The paper describes how we have moved from relatively simple shallow-water models to more complex coupled open ocean circulation models for describing this event. The authors also call for further exploration of all methods for modeling ENSO and communicating these findings so that we may continue to imporove on our understanding, monitoring, and forcasting abilities regarding these events [Guilyardi et al., 2010]. Recently, in an attempt to further our abilities to predict ENSO events, Federov relates the relatively short time scale of wave propogations across the Pacific to the longer time scale of ENSO occurrence frequency. This allows him to produce a simplified, novel approximation of the shallow-water wave equations for modeling ENSO and relate volumeric sea surface temperature anomomiles to thermocline perturbations as well as model the apparent decadal climate variability in the Pacific [Federov, 2010]. This shows how we are constantly redefining this relatively simple system of equations to examine new areas of the same problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, these applications are not limited soley to hydrodynamic modeling. One such application is in regard to atmospheric modeling, since the atmosphere is just another form of a fluid. Jiang used a more complex reduced-gravity shallow-water approximation to model atmospheric layers passing over two-dimensional topography. They were able to derive two non-dimensional parameters that may be used to guage the applicability of shallow-water approximations to atmospheric flows [Jiang, 2014]. Even though they are not shallow-water waves in the strictest sense of the term, these equations are also regularly used to simulate tsunami events. Very recently, Guo et al. build upon tradional non-dispersive shallow-water equations models to produce a time-space decoupled model that produces fast and stable simulations and predictions of tsunami propogation. They provide a well validated model using the typical leap-frog scheme to numerically solve their equations [Guo et al., 2015]. These are just a couple of the applications for shallow-water wave applications. Numerous others have been performed and will continue to be formed due to the simplistic nature and intrinsic ability to accurately represent real world phenomena of this system of equations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this project is to obtain a better understanding of the simplest forms of the shallow-water wave equations and apply this understanding to a simple computer model. This model will attempt to solve the shallow water wave equations within the domain of the pacific ocean to produce a simplified representation of the ENSO event. To do this I will use the shallow-water approximation in the presence of roation on an f-plane. This means that the coriolis parameter will be held constant.\n",

    "The scheme above is becoming unstable very rapidly, with the height perturbation rapidly approaching negative infinity. It seems like I am able to stabilize it around some low negative number by adjusting the initial velocities of u,v. I believe that this is most likely due to the large scale of dx,dy in comparison to other values, but I am not sure how to reasonable scale them down any farther. I have also experimented with several different means of initializing the model When change the initial velocities the entire bottom of my ocean is sinking out, or it is exploding if I make the initial velocities negative. I can also make a cool animation of a chair being formed from a flat plate by creating a boolean to initialize the height animation in conjunction with negative initial velocities. I have run out of ways in which to do this as well, although they each do appear to have a different ramification. "

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "I have definately learned a lot about shallow water waves during my time in this course. I have also advanced my knowledge within Python a great deal! I now regularly use iPython notebooks for personal everyday tasks. Unfortunately, it does not appear that the knowledge gained was enough to produce a stable model. I know that I am going wrong with my stability calculation and parameterization somewhere. I do believe that the majority of my code is valid however, because I have been able to make similar programs work inside of Matlab. I know that I am on the right track and given an extended amount of time and perhaps some critical guidance, I could have this scheme up and running. I will say that I spent numerous hours on this project and improving my knowledge around this topic, so I hope that that will be taken into consideration while grades are being assigned. Overall, I had enjoyable times with this assignment, and times where I wanted to throw my computer out of the window (right now is one of those times). \n",
    "\n",
    "I, Ian, and Yu collaborated on this projects on a regular basis. There were schemes that originated from each of us. To the best of my knowledge, none of us were able to produce a completely stable model that will propogate the breadth of the Pacific and back. Ian figured out how to perform the color mapping and was most pleased with that visual. I was able to fgure out how to produce the matplotlib wireframe movie within the framework of the JSAnimation module that you provided. I prefer that method as I believe it has the most potential for displaying a propogating wave and I am fairly sure that the code I have produced above will produce a pleasing visual providing that one is able to produce a stable model. I believe that Ian will be providing you with the most comprehensive set of schemes. I can assure you that I did try pretty much every one that he did, but I figured it was pointless to provide you with 5 pages of non-working code when it is most likely that small changes to any one of the schemes will produce a working model. Some of the other schemes that I and the others have attempted to implement are the Euler method, upwind scheme, and Lax-Wendfroff scheme. I am sure that I have made a few other non-sensical ones up along the way in my frustrated moments.\n",
